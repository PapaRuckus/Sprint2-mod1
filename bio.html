      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Henry Thomas Zebrowski, Jr. (born May 1, 1984) is an American actor,
        podcast host, and comedian, known for his work on the Adult Swim series
        Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell, the NBC series Heroes Reborn, and the
        podcast The Last Podcast on the Left.
      </p>
      <p>
        He brings a baroque, nay, post-modern air to the show with his amusing
        impressions, vocal gymnastics and willingness to humiliate himself in
        public on a weekly basis. His favourite topics include burritos,
        plugging his latest TV show, burritos, researching and hosting podcasts
        in the nude, burritos, puns about bottoms, and burritos.
      </p>
      <p>
        His hobbies include making minute rice in 58 seconds, yelling about
        aliens to random people and burning effigies of JFK on the moon with jet
        fuel.
